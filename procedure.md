Step 1) Sift all the dry ingredients together - all purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a large mixing bowl.
Step 2) add the wet ingredients milk, eggs, butter, vanilla and sugar to the dry ingredients and combine well.
Step 3) Divide the cake mix into 2 halves and transfer it into 2 9 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper and bake it for 30-35 minutes at 350 F
Step 4) Cherry syrup:
In a sauce pan heat 2 cups of cherry with syrup and 1/4 cup sugar and cook until the syrup thickens. I used bottled sour cherries .
Reserve some of the cherry syrup for later use .

Step 5) If the tooth pick inserted at the center comes out clean then the cakes are perfectly done. My cakes were ready exactly after 30 minutes.
Transfer the cakes to wire rack and let it cool completely.
Step 6) Once the cakes are cooled completely slice each cake into 2 equal halves. Then apply some cherry syrup on the top of each layer to keep the cake moist and soft. This is very important step to keep the cakes soft and at the same time do not add too much syrup or the cakes will become soggy.

Step 7) Cream:
In a large mixing bowl add heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar and whisk them together until soft peaks are formed. I refrigerated my mixing bowl and the whisk for 1 hour before whisking them together. 

Step 8) Assembling the cake: 
Place the first layer of the cake and apply some cream on the top and then spread it evenly. Then add some cherry toppings and then place the second layer of cake and then continue the same. 

Step 9) Cover the entire cake with the cream and add some chocolate shavings on the top and sides and top it with cherries.
